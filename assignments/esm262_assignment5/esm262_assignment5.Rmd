#calculate power generated from a flubber sample with mass 10g (parameter), viscosity 250 cP (input), rotation speed 3.5 m/s (input), exposed to 210 lumens of brightness (parameter)

flubber_power(viscosity = 250, rotation = 3.5)

```

We have three samples of flubber, each with a mass of 10g, rotation speed of 2.5, and exposure to 210 lumens of brightness. Each has a different viscosity.

```{r for loop}

viscosity_vec <- c(150, 1500, 5000)

results <- list()

# loop viscosity vector for power generation
for (i in seq_along(viscosity_vec)) {
  result <- flubber_power(viscosity = viscosity_vec[i], rotation = 2.5, mass = 10, brightness = 210)
  results[[i]] <- result
}

head(results)

flub_df <- data.frame(viscosity = viscosity, power_gen = sapply(results, "[[", "power_lvl"))
### ERROR: ARGUMENTS IMPLY DIFFERING NUMBER OF ROWS: 3, 0  ????
```

```{r plot}

# create bar plot: viscosity vs power generated
ggplot(flub_df, aes(x = viscosity, y = power_gen)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill= "viscosity") +
  labs(x = "Viscosity (cP)", y = "Power Generated (W)")

```

We have three samples of flubber, each with a mass of 10g and exposure to 210 lumens of brightness. Each has a different viscosity and rotation speed.

```{r pmap}

# flubber samples
viscosity_vec2 <- c(500, 1000, 1500)
rotation_vec <- c(2.5, 5, 10)

#run a pmap for sample vectors
power = pmap(list(viscosity = viscosity_vec2, rotation = rotation_vec),
             flubber_power)
