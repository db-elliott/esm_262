Write a function that takes a vector of fish names and always returns three items:
- the most common fish,
- the rarest fish
- the total number of fish


```{r source function}

# relevant function--aka fish count function
source("../R/fish_counts.R")
```

```{r data}

#read in data
fish_catch <- read.delim("../data/fish")
```

```{r data wrangling}

#make data a vector
fish_catch <- as.vector(fish_catch[, 1])

#make data a factor
fish_catch <- as.factor(fish_catch)

# look at summary--aka counts of all five fish species
(summary(fish_catch))

```

```{r use function}

fish_counts(fish_catch)

# returns "300", "salmon", and "tuna" for total_fish, dominant, and rarest
# correct!!!

```
