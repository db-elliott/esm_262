```

Write a function that takes a vector of fish names and always returns three items:
- the most common fish,
- the rarest fish
- the total number of fish

```{r data}

#read in data
fish_catch <- read.delim(here("assignments", "data", "fish"))
```

```{r}

#make data a vector
fish_catch <- as.vector(fish_catch[, 1])

#make data a factor
fish_catch <- as.factor(fish_catch)

(summary(fish_catch))

```

```{r use function}

source("C:/Users/deann/Box/Winter 2023/esm_262/R/fish_counts.R")

fish_counts(fish_catch)

# returns "300", "salmon", and "tuna" for total_fish, dominant, and rarest
# correct!!!

```
